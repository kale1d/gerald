## Thoughts about the challenge 

My first reaction seeing the gif and reading the challenge was "oh this is easy" but when i started to code the drawer and want to animate it, i changed my mind. When i couldn't find the way to animate the drawer of react navigation i tried to made my own, but then when i finished that my mind said "nope, you can do it with the drawer prop" so i watched the gif many times and then i saw it the border radius made the trick there is no overlapping of the screen in the drawer, and everything ended up fine :P.
After that i wanted to type all the navigation and another round of investigation came up. As a lesson, I learned that nothing is as easy as it seems if you want to do it well.
